These tokens were used to authorize requests to specific endpoints. \\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC): A system was designed where users could be assigned specific roles like \\nadmin, user, or guest. Each role had different levels of permissions, and users were granted access to resources \\nbased on their roles. \\nPostgreSQL Database Design: The database schema was carefully designed to handle users, roles, \\npermissions, and refresh tokens. This structure ensured that the system could scale effectively while \\nmaintaining secure access controls. \\nFastAPI for API Development: FastAPI was used to develop secure API endpoints for handling \\nauthentication, role assignment, token generation, and permission checks. FastAPI's high performance was \\nbeneficial for handling a large number of requests efficiently. \\nSQLModel for Database ORM: SQLModel was used as an ORM tool to simplify database interactions, \\nallowing for clear and concise code when querying the PostgreSQL database. \\n \\nIssues Faced ⚠️ \\nManaging User Roles and Permissions: \\nInitially, it was challenging to implement a flexible, scalable, and maintainable system that handled multiple \\nuser roles and their associated permissions across different resources. The system needed to ensure that users \\nhad the correct access based on their roles. \\nHandling Dependencies and Modular Design: \\nWith several components depending on each other (JWTs, roles, permissions, and tokens), it became \\nnecessary to decouple services and ensure modularity to facilitate future changes and expansions. \\nSecurity of API Endpoints: \\nEnsuring that only authorized users could access certain API endpoints was a core challenge. Managing this \\nwhile also allowing seamless user experiences was critical. \\n \\nSolution Proposed 💡 \\nJWT Authentication: \\nThe JWT approach was chosen to handle stateless authentication, where a token is issued once the user logs \\nin, and this token is used for subsequent requests to access protected routes. The token has an expiration time, \\nand a refresh token mechanism was introduced to allow users to extend their sessions. \\nRBAC Implementation:\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Skia/PDF m136 Google Docs Renderer', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Akshat Tyagi Final Internship Report 8th Sem.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Akshat Tyagi Final Internship Report 8th Sem.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Akshat Tyagi Final Internship Report 8th Sem', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 14}, page_content=\"Users were assigned roles (admin, user, etc.), and each role was mapped to certain permissions (read, write, \\ndelete). This system ensures that access to resources is controlled at the user level, with only users with \\nspecific roles able to perform certain actions. \\nPostgreSQL Database Schema: \\nTables were created for managing users, roles, permissions, and their relationships. The following \\nrelationships were mapped: \\nUserRoles: Connecting users to their respective roles \\nRolePermissions: Connecting roles to their corresponding permissions \\nPermissions: Each permission defines a specific action a user can perform (like reading or writing data) \\nAPI Endpoints: \\nSpecific endpoints were created for registration, login, token refresh, and role management. These endpoints \\nfollowed REST principles and utilized FastAPI's built-in security features to ensure proper validation and \\nauthorization. \\n \\nSolution Implemented Till Now ✅ \\nPostgreSQL Database Design: \\nThe users, roles, permissions, and user_roles tables were set up to store data for each component of the IAM \\nsystem. This ensures that relationships between users, roles, and permissions are clearly defined and easily \\naccessible for API queries. \\nFastAPI Development: \\nEndpoints were created to allow users to log in, get access tokens, and refresh their tokens. Each endpoint \\nenforces security measures, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain endpoints. These endpoints \\nare secured by JWT authentication and RBAC. \\nSecurity Layers: \\nAPI endpoints used JWTs to validate user sessions. Roles and permissions were checked at each access point \\nto ensure the user had the correct level of authorization. \\n \\nTesting: \\nAutomated tests were written to verify the functionality of the IAM system. Thesetests include checking the \\nvalidity of the JWTs, role-based access control, and ensuring that token expiration and refresh mechanisms \\nwork correctly. \\nPydantic for Data Validation: \\nData validation and serialization were handled using Pydantic to ensure that the input data in requests was \\nvalid and correctly formatted. This minimized the risk of security vulnerabilities from malicious inputs. \\nCode Quality: \\nLinting tools like Flake8 and PyLint were integrated to ensure the quality and consistency of the code. A \\npre-commit hook was set up to automatically run these linters before code is committed, enforcing code \\nstandards across the team. \\n \\nConclusion 📝 \\nThis project successfully implemented a highly secure Identity and Access Management system that uses \\nFastAPI, SQLModel, and PostgreSQL to handle authentication, authorization, and secure token management. \\nThe modular architecture ensures that the IAM system can scale and evolve over time to support new features, \\nsuch as additional roles, permissions, and security protocols. \\nThe integration of JWT authentication, RBAC, and refresh tokens provides a strong foundation for managing\"), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Skia/PDF m136 Google Docs Renderer', 'creator': '', 'creationdate': '', 'source': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Akshat Tyagi Final Internship Report 8th Sem.pdf', 'file_path': '..\\\\data\\\\pdf\\\\Akshat Tyagi Final Internship Report 8th Sem.pdf', 'total_pages': 17, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'Akshat Tyagi Final Internship Report 8th Sem', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': '', 'creationDate': '', 'page': 15}, page_content=\"user access securely, while the use of PostgreSQL for relational data modeling ensures efficient questions. \\n \\n10.

After  prototyping  and  evaluating  both  Umbraco  and  Strapi,  we  adopted  Strapi  as  the  CMS  of  choice.  The  research  allowed  seamless  coordination  with  the  frontend  and  backend  teams,  and  directly  impacted  the  API  architecture  and  content  flow.    Project  3:  Stable  Web  App  Proxy  for  Ngrok-Based  Backend  (Safe  Delivery  App  Phase  1)  Project  Summary  📋  During  the  early  development  and  testing  of  the  Safe  Delivery  App,  the  backend  APIs  were  exposed  to  the  frontend  team  using  ngrok.  While  ngrok  served  its  purpose  for  quick  local  development  exposure,  it  generated  new  URLs  every  time  the  backend  restarted.  This  created  issues  for  the  Denmark  QA  and  frontend  teams,  who  needed  a  stable  and  consistent  endpoint  for  API  testing,  particularly  during  certification  generation  and  module  content  validation.  Solution  Approach  🔍  To  ensure  stable  and  continuous  access  for  the  QA  and  frontend  team:  I  deployed  a  small  Azure  Web  App  that  acted  as  a  reverse  proxy  to  the  dynamically  changing  ngrok  backend  This  Azure  Web  App  was  configured  with  a  custom  domain  and  kept  live  24/7  Every  time  a  new  ngrok  URL  was  created  locally,  I  would  update  a  proxy  variable  or  endpoint  in  the  Azure  Web  App  to  redirect  traffic  This  gave  the  frontend  team  a  stable  URL  that  they  could  integrate  with  and  test  without  asking  for  new  URLs  every  time.

These  tokens  were  used  to  authorize  requests  to  specific  endpoints.  Role-Based  Access  Control  (RBAC):  A  system  was  designed  where  users  could  be  assigned  specific  roles  like  admin,  user,  or  guest.  Each  role  had  different  levels  of  permissions,  and  users  were  granted  access  to  resources  based  on  their  roles.  PostgreSQL  Database  Design:  The  database  schema  was  carefully  designed  to  handle  users,  roles,  permissions,  and  refresh  tokens.  This  structure  ensured  that  the  system  could  scale  effectively  while  maintaining  secure  access  controls.  FastAPI  for  API  Development:  FastAPI  was  used  to  develop  secure  API  endpoints  for  handling  authentication,  role  assignment,  token  generation,  and  permission  checks.  FastAPI's  high  performance  was  beneficial  for  handling  a  large  number  of  requests  efficiently.  SQLModel  for  Database  ORM:  SQLModel  was  used  as  an  ORM  tool  to  simplify  database  interactions,  allowing  for  clear  and  concise  code  when  querying  the  PostgreSQL  database.   Issues  Faced  ⚠  Managing  User  Roles  and  Permissions:  Initially,  it  was  challenging  to  implement  a  flexible,  scalable,  and  maintainable  system  that  handled  multiple  user  roles  and  their  associated  permissions  across  different  resources.  The  system  needed  to  ensure  that  users  had  the  correct  access  based  on  their  roles.  Handling  Dependencies  and  Modular  Design:  With  several  components  depending  on  each  other  (JWTs,  roles,  permissions,  and  tokens),  it  became  necessary  to  decouple  services  and  ensure  modularity  to  facilitate  future  changes  and  expansions.  Security  of  API  Endpoints:  Ensuring  that  only  authorized  users  could  access  certain  API  endpoints  was  a  core  challenge.  Managing  this  while  also  allowing  seamless  user  experiences  was  critical.   Solution  Proposed  💡  JWT  Authentication:  The  JWT  approach  was  chosen  to  handle  stateless  authentication,  where  a  token  is  issued  once  the  user  logs  in,  and  this  token  is  used  for  subsequent  requests  to  access  protected  routes.  The  token  has  an  expiration  time,  and  a  refresh  token  mechanism  was  introduced  to  allow  users  to  extend  their  sessions.  RBAC  Implementation:\"),\n",

This  system  ensures  that  access  to  resources  is  controlled  at  the  user  level,  with  only  users  with  specific  roles  able  to  perform  certain  actions.  PostgreSQL  Database  Schema:  Tables  were  created  for  managing  users,  roles,  permissions,  and  their  relationships.  The  following  relationships  were  mapped:  UserRoles:  Connecting  users  to  their  respective  roles  RolePermissions :  Connecting  roles  to  their  corresponding  permissions  Permissions :  Each  permission  defines  a  specific  action  a  user  can  perform  (like  reading  or  writing  data)  API  Endpoints:  Specific  endpoints  were  created  for  registration,  login,  token  refresh,  and  role  management.  These  endpoints  followed  REST  principles  and  utilized  FastAPI's  built-in  security  features  to  ensure  proper  validation  and  authorization.   Solution  Implemented  Till  Now  ✅  PostgreSQL  Database  Design :  The  users,  roles,  permissions,  and  user_roles  tables  were  set  up  to  store  data  for  each  component  of  the  IAM  system.  This  ensures  that  relationships  between  users,  roles,  and  permissions  are  clearly  defined  and  easily  accessible  for  API  queries.  FastAPI  Development:  Endpoints  were  created  to  allow  users  to  log  in,  get  access  tokens,  and  refresh  their  tokens.  Each  endpoint  enforces  security  measures,  ensuring  that  only  authorized  users  can  access  certain  endpoints.  These  endpoints  are  secured  by  JWT  authentication  and  RBAC.  Security  Layers:  API  endpoints  used  JWTs  to  validate  user  sessions.  Roles  and  permissions  were  checked  at  each  access  point  to  ensure  the  user  had  the  correct  level  of  authorization.  \\n Testing:  Automated  tests  were  written  to  verify  the  functionality  of  the  IAM  system.  Thesetests  include  checking  the  validity  of  the  JWTs,  role-based  access  control,  and  ensuring  that  token  expiration  and  refresh  mechanisms  work  correctly.  Pydantic  for  Data  Validation:  Data  validation  and  serialization  were  handled  using  Pydantic  to  ensure  that  the  input  data  in  requests  was  valid  and  correctly  formatted.  This  minimized  the  risk  of  security  vulnerabilities  from  malicious  inputs.  Code  Quality:  Linting  tools  like  Flake8  and  PyLint  were  integrated  to  ensure  the  quality  and  consistency  of  the  code.  A  pre-commit  hook  was  set  up  to  automatically  run  these  linters  before  code  is  committed,  enforcing  code  standards  across  the  team.   Conclusion  📝  This  project  successfully  implemented  a  highly  secure  Identity  and  Access  Management  system  that  uses  FastAPI,  SQLModel,  and  PostgreSQL  to  handle  authentication,  authorization,  and  secure  token  management.  The  modular  architecture  ensures  that  the  IAM  system  can  scale  and  evolve  over  time  to  support  new  features,  such  as  additional  roles,  permissions,  and  security  protocols.  The  integration  of  JWT  authentication,  RBAC,  and  refresh  tokens  provides  a  strong  foundation  for  managing\"),\n",
